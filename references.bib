	abstract = {We give a geometric interpretation for the principle of stationary action in classical Lagrangian particle mechanics. In a nutshell, the difference of the action along a path and its variation effectively “counts” the possible evolutions that “go through” the area enclosed. If the path corresponds to a possible evolution, all neighbouring evolutions will be parallel, making them tangent to the area enclosed by the path and its variation, thus yielding a stationary action. This treatment gives a full physical account of the geometry of both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics which is founded on three assumptions: determinism and reversible evolution, independence of the degrees of freedom and equivalence between kinematics and dynamics. The logical equivalence between the three assumptions and the principle of stationary action leads to a much cleaner conceptual understanding.},

He saw how to eliminate from Euler’s methods of 1744 the tedium and need for geometrical insight and to reduce the entire process to a quite analytic machine or apparatus, which could turn out the necessary condition of Euler and more, almost automatically. This basic idea of Lagrange ushered in a new epoch in the calculus of variations. Indeed after seeing Lagrange’s work, Euler dropped his own method, espoused that of Lagrange, and renamed the subject the calculus of variations.1},

	abstract = {Fermat wrote nine interesting and important papers on the method of maxima and minima which are grouped together in his collected works. The last two in this set were sent by him in 1662 as attachments to a letter to a colleague, Marin Cureau de la Chambre.1 As their titles, “The analysis of refractions” and “The synthesis of refractions,” imply, they are companion derivations of the law of refraction, now usually known as Snell’s law. These papers are fundamental for us because Fermat enunciates in them his principle that “nature operates by means and ways that are ‘easiest and fastest.’” He goes on to state that it is not generally true that “nature always acts along shortest paths” (this was the assumption of de la Chambre). Indeed, he cites the example of Galileo that when particles move under the action of gravity they proceed along paths that take the least time to traverse, and not along ones that are of the least length.2 This enunciation by Fermat is, as far as I am aware, the first one to appear in correct form and to be used properly.},

Carathéodory, who edited Euler’s magnificent 1744 opus, The Method of Finding Plane Curves that Show Some Property of Maximum or Minimum … , believed it unlikely that it occurred during his period in Basel with John Bernoulli.1 However, we should note that Euler considered in 1732 and 1736 problems more or less arising out of James Bernoulli’s isoperimetric problems; and even as early as the end of 1728 or early in 1729, as Eneström showed, he wrote “On finding the equation of geodesic curves.” In effect, Euler in 1744, following John Bernoulli, examined the question of end-curves that cut a family of geodesics so that they have equal length. He showed that the end-curves must be orthogonal to the geodesics. This is the precursor of the so-called envelope theorem of Chapter 7 below and plays a key part in Carathéodory’s work.},

	abstract = {Micro air vehicles ({MAVs}) have the potential to revolutionize our sensing and information gathering capabilities in areas such as environmental monitoring and homeland security. Flapping wings with suitable wing kinematics, wing shapes, and flexible structures can enhance lift as well as thrust by exploiting large-scale vortical flow structures under various conditions. However, the scaling invariance of both fluid dynamics and structural dynamics as the size changes is fundamentally difficult. The focus of this review is to assess the recent progress in flapping wing aerodynamics and aeroelasticity. It is realized that a variation of the Reynolds number (wing sizing, flapping frequency, etc.) leads to a change in the leading edge vortex ({LEV}) and spanwise flow structures, which impacts the aerodynamic force generation. While in classical stationary wing theory, the tip vortices ({TiVs}) are seen as wasted energy, in flapping flight, they can interact with the {LEV} to enhance lift without increasing the power requirements. Surrogate modeling techniques can assess the aerodynamic outcomes between two- and three-dimensional wing. The combined effect of the {TiVs}, the {LEV}, and jet can improve the aerodynamics of a flapping wing. Regarding aeroelasticity, chordwise flexibility in the forward flight can substantially adjust the projected area normal to the flight trajectory via shape deformation, hence redistributing thrust and lift. Spanwise flexibility in the forward flight creates shape deformation from the wing root to the wing tip resulting in varied phase shift and effective angle of attack distribution along the wing span. Numerous open issues in flapping wing aerodynamics are highlighted.},
